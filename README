Scripps genomic medicine researchers are looking to America’s “healthy elderly” — those 85 
and older with no history of chronic disease — to help unlock the genetic secrets behind 
lifelong health.

Led by Eric Topol, MD, the “Wellderly Study” seeks 2,000 elderly volunteers to donate 
their DNA to the program’s gene bank. One-time blood samples will be studied by Scripps 
researchers to uncover the protective elements of the human genetic code. 
The program is open to people of all ethnic backgrounds living in the United States.
